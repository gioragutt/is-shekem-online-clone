# is-shekem-online-clone

This project is done in preparation of moving to a NodeJS + GraphQL +  React stack.

Original implementation is:
* VueJS for frontend (based on favicon)
* Express for backend, served by an Erlang(??), based on following response headers:
```
Server: Cowboy         // That's erlang
Via: 1.1 vegur         // That's erlang
X-Powered-By: Express  // IDK what that is, really ðŸ¤·
```

# Goals

* Although I'm familiar with React from the past and have kept myself up to date, I need to get my feet wet again.
* Actually implement a GraphQL server with a database backend, and not just read and talk about it.
